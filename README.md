# 9DaysOfAPIs

## About
As a SysAdmin who uses Python for automating/simplifying certain tasks, I've always wanted to do more.
I by no means claim to be a developer, but enjoy it as a hobby and a way to advance my career.
This little project is a way for me to get used making API calls with Python. All of the topics
of the APIs are things that I think are interesting or funny.

This project started out at 30 days of APIs, and then 21. However, it was easier to find 9 interesting APIs
than 30.

While all of the projects will use argparse for certain variables, keep in mind that it is probably safer to 
set an environment variable with your API keys.

## Activities
### Day 1 - NASA Astronomy Photos
nasa-apod.py
Simple CLI app that takes a NASA API key and grabs the APOD for today, or the specified date, and downloads it to the current directory.
Arguments:
[optional] `--api-key` The api.nasa.gov API key to use. Defaults to DEMO_KEY.
[optional] `--date` The date to grab the photo from. Defaults to today.


## Lessons Learned
- MVP (minimum viable product) is easy.
